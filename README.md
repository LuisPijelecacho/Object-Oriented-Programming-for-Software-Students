My name is Luis Perez, I was born in Aguascalientes City in Febuary 16th of 1999. I enjoy coding on many projects I am passionate about, thos e projects tend to be about other interests I have in life like camping and the great outdoors, I will keep working hard to become the best developer I can be. 

I am taking this class to finally do something that I really enjoy doing, whish is solving problems and helping people get to where they want to be with programs that are user friendly as well as useful. I am going to become a great developer soon.
